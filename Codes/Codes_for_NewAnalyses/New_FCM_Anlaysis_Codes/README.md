### New\_FCM\_Anlaysis\_Codes
Here the user can use the provided scripts to test our optimized and final weighted modeling strategy on a new data set (as we did for our paper):
1. **BODIPY\_signal\_histPlot\_ColorCoded.m**:  
Use this script to see the signal intensities of the BODIPY dye, recorded by the flow cytometer.
2. **Test\_RunFCSC\_3M\_Log.m**:  
Use this script (which automatically uses the "FCSC\_3M\_Log.m" as its object) to test our model on the new data set that are stored int he folder "FCM\_data". The results are already saved in the folder "Results" for convenience. The user can alter the desired replications to view various results. We just showed one replication here.
