### Codes
In this folder, 2 scripts can be run by the user:
1. **BODIPY\_signal\_histPlot\_ColorCoded.m**:  
Run this script to see the BODIPY signals collected by the flow cytometer.
2. **RunFCSC\_3M\_Log.m (THE MAIN SCRIPT)**:  
Run this script (which automatically uses the *FCSC\_3M\_Log.m* file as its object) to analyze our main flow cytometry data and see the results at different computation steps. This script provides a weighted model at its last step in our strategy.
